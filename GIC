    -SGI(Software-generated interrupt) 0-15
      :SGIs are generated by writing to the Software Generated Interrupt Register, GICD_SGIR.
       Each CPU interface can generate a maximum of 16 SGIs, ID0-ID15, for each target processor. 
       SGIs are used mainly in interprocess communication.
       
    -PPI(Private peripheral interrupt) 16-31
      :A PPI is an interrupt that is specific to a single processor. All PPI signals are active-LOW level-sensitive. 
       For example, the interrupts generated by local timer of each CPU send to CPU by mechanism of PPI.
       
    -SPI(Shared peripheral interrupt) 
      :SPIs are triggered by events generated on associated interrupt input lines. 
       The GIC-400 can support up to 480 SPIs corresponding to the external IRQS[479:0]signal. 
       The number of SPIs available depends on the implemented configuration of the GIC-400. 
       The permitted values are 0-480, in steps of 32. SPIs start at ID32.
       You can configure whether each SPI is edge-triggered on a rising edge or is active-HIGH level-sensitive.
